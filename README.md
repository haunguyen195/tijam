# Tijam
### Tijam has not been built and tested on IOS, there are a lot of bugs and the code is not clean
## I don't have much time for Tijam.
 
Tijam is a personal app that builds itself up in a few impromptu minutes and takes advantage of free time after a long day at work. Basically, there's not much, with Tijam you can post the information, the mood or whatever you want to share with those around you as well as discover what people around you share.

If you're interested in source code or want to develop Tijam, try it. I'm happy about that.
